# ArchetypeJavaFX

I have not mastered how to use Git from within an IDE to uplaod folders and files not normally associated with a Java project. Since this project can no longer execute properly and is only to be used to install the archetype I have only included the archetype component in a zip file. Download the zip and open a command window in the archetype folder. Issue mvn install and the archetype is ready to be used.
